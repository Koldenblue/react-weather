<hr><h3 id='description'>Description</h3>
The deployed app is viewable <a href='https://kmiller-react-weather.herokuapp.com/'>here</a>. A video demonstration of the app may be viewed on <a href='https://youtu.be/hN__lsQoW4w'>YouTube</a>. The app uses the OpenWeather API in order to offer a 5 day forecast. Alternatively, the user may switch to a more detailed view of the forecast for the upcoming day. Recently searched cities are tracked with a search bar. Finally, the app allows for simulation of a delay in the AJAX call to the OpenWeather API, by increasing loading screen times.
